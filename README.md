# README Generator

## User Story

 AS AN up-and-coming software developer, I WANT to spend less time generating README.md documents SO I CAN spend more time on my projects.

## Before Running Application

* make sure you have node.js installed on your machine

1. Within your preferred local code editor(I prefer VS studio), open the desired folder where you'd like to generate your README
2. Open your terminal within your code editor
3. Install npm by running npm install in the terminal
4. Install inquirer by running inquirer install in the terminal

## To run application
Type "node index.js" in the terminal and follow the prompts.
You will get a console.log with your responses as a preview of what the README will contain.
The README.md will be found in the desired folder.

Voil√°.
